# Dog Breed Classifier

We [built a dog breed classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dei0O1PDDkI) while working through the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course "Practical Deep Learning for Coders".

Here's [how we finally managed to deploy it correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH5AE6XdStg&t=8225s) and you can try the classifier live on Binder by clicking the button:

Wait for the Binder app to deploy, then upload an image and click on <kbd>Classify</kbd>.
